        Introduction
      </h1>
      <p>
        In this chapter, we enter the building site and start constructing
        the CLFS system in earnest. The installation of this software is
        straightforward. Although in many cases the installation instructions
        could be made shorter and more generic, we have opted to provide the
        full instructions for every package to minimize the possibilities for
        mistakes. The key to learning what makes a Linux system work is to
        know what each package is used for and why the user (or the system)
        needs it. For every installed package, a summary of its contents is
        given, followed by concise descriptions of each program and library
        the package installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The order that packages are installed in this chapter needs to be
        strictly followed to ensure that no program accidentally acquires a
        path referring to <code class="filename">${CLFS}/cross-tools</code>
        hard-wired into it. For the same reason, do not compile packages in
        parallel. Compiling more than one package at a time may save time,
        but it could result in a program containing a hard-wired path to
        <code class="filename">${CLFS}/cross-tools</code>, which will cause
        the program to stop working when that directory is removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compiling any single package using make's parallel job execution
        option, "-j" is OK if you want to speed up compiling any one package.
