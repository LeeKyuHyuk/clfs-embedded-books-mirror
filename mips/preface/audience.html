      <p>
        There are many reasons why somebody would want to read this book. The
        principal reason is to install a Linux system from the source code. A
        question many people raise is, &ldquo;<span class="quote">why go
        through all the hassle of manually building a Linux system from
        scratch when you can just download and install an existing
        one?</span>&rdquo; That is a good question and is the impetus for
        this section of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        One important reason for the existence of CLFS is to help people
        understand how a Linux system works. Building an CLFS system helps
        demonstrate what makes Linux tick, and how things work together and
        depend on each other. One of the best things this learning experience
        provides is the ability to customize Linux to your own tastes and
        needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key benefit of CLFS is that it allows users to have more control
        over their system without any reliance on a Linux implementation
        designed by someone else. With CLFS, <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>you</em></span> are in the driver's seat and dictate
        every aspect of the system, such as the directory layout and
        bootscript setup. You also dictate where, why, and how programs are
        installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another benefit of CLFS is the ability to create a very compact Linux
        system. When installing a regular distribution, one is often forced
        to include several programs which are probably never used. These
        programs waste disk space or CPU cycles. It is not difficult to build
        an CLFS Embedded system of less than 10 megabytes (MB), which is
        substantially smaller than the majority of existing installations.
        Try that with a regular distribution!
      </p>
      <p>
        We could compare Linux distributions to a hamburger purchased at a
        fast-food restaurant&mdash;you have no idea what might be in what you
        are eating. CLFS, on the other hand, does not give you a hamburger.
        Rather, CLFS provides the recipe to make the exact hamburger desired.
        This allows users to review the recipe, omit unwanted ingredients,
        and add your own ingredients to enhance the flavor of the burger.
        When you are satisfied with the recipe, move on to preparing it. It
        can be made to exact specifications&mdash;broil it, bake it, deep-fry
        it, or barbecue it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another analogy that we can use is that of comparing CLFS with a
        finished house. CLFS provides the skeletal plan of a house, but it is
        up to you to build it. CLFS maintains the freedom to adjust plans
        throughout the process, customizing it to the needs and preferences
        of the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security is an additional advantage of a custom built Linux system.
        By compiling the entire system from source code, you are empowered to
        audit everything and apply all the security patches desired. It is no
        longer necessary to wait for somebody else to compile binary packages
        that fix a security hole. Unless you examine the patch and implement
        it yourself, you have no guarantee that the new binary package was
        built correctly and adequately fixes the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of Cross Linux From Scratch is to build a complete and
        usable foundation-level system. Readers who do not wish to build
        their own Linux system from scratch may not benefit from the
        information in this book. If you only want to know what happens while
        the computer boots, we recommend the &ldquo;<span class="quote">From
        Power Up To Bash Prompt</span>&rdquo; HOWTO located at <a class=
        "ulink" href=
        "http://axiom.anu.edu.au/~okeefe/p2b/">http://axiom.anu.edu.au/~okeefe/p2b/</a>
        or on The Linux Documentation Project's (TLDP) website at <a class=
        "ulink" href=
        "http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html</a>.
        The HOWTO builds a system which is similar to that of this book, but
        it focuses strictly on creating a system capable of booting to a
        shell prompt. Consider your objective. If you wish to build a Linux
        system and learn along the way, this book is your best choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are too many good reasons to build your own CLFS system to list
        them all here. This section is only the tip of the iceberg. As you
        continue in your CLFS experience, you will find the power that
        information and knowledge truly bring.
