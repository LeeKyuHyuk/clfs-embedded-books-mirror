      <h2>
        I. REQUIREMENTS ON BOTH UNMODIFIED AND MODIFIED VERSIONS
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Open Publication works may be reproduced and distributed in whole
        or in part, in any medium physical or electronic, provided that the
        terms of this license are adhered to, and that this license or an
        incorporation of it by reference (with any options elected by the
        author(s) and/or publisher) is displayed in the reproduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proper form for an incorporation by reference is as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>
            Copyright © 1999-2017 by each contributor. This material may be
            distributed only subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
            the Open Publication License, v1.0 or later (the latest version
            is presently available at <a class="ulink" href=
            "http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/">http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/</a>).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p>
        The reference must be immediately followed with any options elected
        by the author(s) and/or publisher of the document (see section VI).
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial redistribution of Open Publication-licensed material is
        permitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any publication in standard (paper) book form shall require the
        citation of the original publisher and author. The publisher and
        author's names shall appear on all outer surfaces of the book. On all
        outer surfaces of the book the original publisher's name shall be as
        large as the bridgehead of the work and cited as possessive with
        respect to the bridgehead.
      </p>
      <h2>
        II. COPYRIGHT
      </h2>
      <p>
        The copyright to each Open Publication is owned by its author(s) or
        designee.
      </p>
      <h2>
        III. SCOPE OF LICENSE
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following license terms apply to all Open Publication works,
        unless otherwise explicitly stated in the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mere aggregation of Open Publication works or a portion of an Open
        Publication work with other works or programs on the same media shall
        not cause this license to apply to those other works. The aggregate
        work shall contain a notice specifying the inclusion of the Open
        Publication material and appropriate copyright notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEVERABILITY. If any part of this license is found to be
        unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remaining portions of the
        license remain in force.
      </p>
      <p>
        NO WARRANTY. Open Publication works are licensed and provided "as is"
        without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not
        limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
        a particular purpose or a warranty of non-infringement.
      </p>
      <h2>
        IV. REQUIREMENTS ON MODIFIED WORKS
      </h2>
      <p>
        All modified versions of documents covered by this license, including
        translations, anthologies, compilations and partial documents, must
        meet the following requirements:
      </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The modified version must be labeled as such.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The person making the modifications must be identified and the
              modifications dated.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Acknowledgement of the original author and publisher if
              applicable must be retained according to normal academic
              citation practices.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The location of the original unmodified document must be
              identified.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The original author's (or authors') name(s) may not be used to
              assert or imply endorsement of the resulting document without
              the original author's (or authors') permission.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h2>
        V. GOOD-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS
      </h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the requirements of this license, it is requested from
        and strongly recommended of redistributors that:
      </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you are distributing Open Publication works on hardcopy or
              CD-ROM, you provide email notification to the authors of your
              intent to redistribute at least thirty days before your
              manuscript or media freeze, to give the authors time to provide
              updated documents. This notification should describe
              modifications, if any, made to the document.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              All substantive modifications (including deletions) be either
              clearly marked up in the document or else described in an
              attachment to the document.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Finally, while it is not mandatory under this license, it is
              considered good form to offer a free copy of any hardcopy and
              CD-ROM expression of an Open Publication-licensed work to its
              author(s).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h2>
        VI. LICENSE OPTIONS
      </h2>
      <p>
        The author(s) and/or publisher of an Open Publication-licensed
        document may elect certain options by appending language to the
        reference to or copy of the license. These options are considered
        part of the license instance and must be included with the license
        (or its incorporation by reference) in derived works.
      </p>
      <p>
        A. To prohibit distribution of substantively modified versions
        without the explicit permission of the author(s). "Substantive
        modification" is defined as a change to the semantic content of the
        document, and excludes mere changes in format or typographical
        corrections.
      </p>
      <p>
        To accomplish this, add the phrase `Distribution of substantively
        modified versions of this document is prohibited without the explicit
        permission of the copyright holder.' to the license reference or
        copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        B. To prohibit any publication of this work or derivative works in
        whole or in part in standard (paper) book form for commercial
        purposes is prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the
        copyright holder.
      </p>
      <p>
        To accomplish this, add the phrase 'Distribution of the work or
        derivative of the work in any standard (paper) book form is
        prohibited unless prior permission is obtained from the copyright
        holder.' to the license reference or copy.
