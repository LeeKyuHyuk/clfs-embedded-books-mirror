      <p>
        Thank you for reading this CLFS book. We hope that you have found
        this book helpful and have learned more about the system creation
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the CLFS system is installed, you may be wondering
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">What next?</span>&rdquo; To answer that
        question, we have compiled a list of resources for you.
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">

            <p>
              Bugs and security notices are reported regularly for all
              software. Since an CLFS system is compiled from source, it is
              up to you to keep abreast of such reports. There are several
              online resources that track such reports, some of which are
              shown below:

              The Community Driven Beyond Linux From Scratch wiki provides
              information, installation procedures, and other tips for a
              large variety of software that can be installed on a CLFS
              system. The CBLFS wiki is located at <a class="ulink" href=
