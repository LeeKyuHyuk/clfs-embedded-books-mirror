      <p>
        The Linux From Scratch Project has seen many changes in the few years
        of its existence. I personally became involved with the project in
        2000, around the time of the 3.x releases. At that time, the build
        process was to create static binaries with the host system, then
        chroot and build the final binaries on top of the static ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later came the use of the /static directory to hold the initial
        static builds, keeping them separated from the final system, then the
        PureLFS process developed by Ryan Oliver and Greg Schafer,
        introducing a new toolchain build process that divorces even our
        initial builds from the host. Finally, LFS 6 bought Linux Kernel 2.6,
        the udev dynamic device structure, sanitized kernel headers, and
        other improvements to the Linux From Scratch system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one "flaw" in LFS is that it has always been based on an x86
        class processor. With the advent of the Athlon 64 and Intel EM64T
        processors, the x86-only LFS is no longer ideal. Throughout this
        time, Ryan Oliver developed and documented a process by which you
        could build Linux for any system and from any system, by use of
        cross-compilation techniques. Thus, the Cross-Compiled LFS (CLFS) was
        born.
      </p>
      <p>
        CLFS Embedded follows the same guiding principles the LFS project has
        always followed, e.g., knowing your system inside and out by virtue
        of having built the system yourself. Additionally, during a CLFS
        Embedded build, you will learn advanced techniques such as
        cross-build toolchains, and how to create a smaller footprint system
        supporting architectures such as ARM and MIPS, in addition to x86.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you enjoy building your own CLFS Embedded system, and the
        benefits that come from a system tailored to your needs.
