        System
      </h1>
      <p>
        The CLFS system will be built by using a previously installed Linux
        distribution (such as Debian, Fedora, Mandriva, SUSE, or Ubuntu).
        This existing Linux system (the host) will be used as a starting
        point to provide necessary programs, including a compiler, linker,
        and shell, to build the new system. Select the &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">development</span>&rdquo; option during the distribution
        installation to be able to access these tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an alternative to installing an entire separate distribution onto
        your machine, you may wish to use the Linux From Scratch LiveCD. This
        CD works well as a host system, providing all the tools you need to
        successfully follow the instructions in this book. It does also
        contain source packages and patches for the LFS book, and a copy of
        the LFS book, but not the needed packages or book for CLFS. You can
        still use the CD for building CLFS, but you will need to download the
        packages, patches and book separately. You can also look at <a class=
        "ulink" href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/lfscd-remastering-howto.txt">
        http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/lfscd-remastering-howto.txt</a>
        for infomation on building your own CD, replacing the LFS packages
        and book with those for CLFS. Once you have the CD, no network
        connection or additional downloads are necessary. For more
        information about the LFS LiveCD or to download a copy, visit

        carefully as it explains several important issues the developer
        should be aware of before beginning to work through <a class="xref"

        "Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Constructing Cross-Compile Tools">Constructing

        <a class="xref" href="../cross-tools/chapter.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Constructing Cross-Compile Tools">Constructing
        Cross-Compile Tools</a> explains the installation of cross-compile
        tools which will be built on the host but be able to compile programs
        that run on the target machine. These cross-compile tools will be
        used to create the final-system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process of building cross-compile tools first involves installing
        binutils into ${CLFS}/cross-tools, so that we have an asembler and a
        linker for our target architecture. GCC is then compiled statically
        and installed into ${CLFS}/cross-tools, this cross-compiler is used
        to build the libc for the final-system. The GCC cross-compiler is
        then rebuilt dynamically - this final cross-compiler is what will be
        used to build the final-system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a class="xref" href="../final-system/chapter.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Installing
        Basic System Software</a>, the full CLFS system is cross-compiled.
        The system is built using a sysroot compiler. Sysroot is a parameter
        passed to binutils and gcc that modifies its default search paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish the installation, the CLFS-Bootscripts are set up in
        <a class="xref" href="../bootscripts/chapter.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Setting Up System Bootscripts">Setting Up
        System Bootscripts</a>, and the kernel and boot loader are set up in

        "../the-end/chapter.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;The End">The
        End</a> contains information on furthering the CLFS experience beyond
        this book. After the steps in this book have been implemented, the
        computer will be ready to reboot into the new CLFS system.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the process in a nutshell. Detailed information on each step
        is discussed in the following chapters and package descriptions.
        Items that may seem complicated will be clarified, and everything
        will fall into place as the reader embarks on the CLFS adventure.
